# DotaData
Machine learning and data-mining project to guess winrates of Dota 2 games based on the heroes chosen, plus several other factors. Sklearn
is the primary library used to analyze the data, as I wanted to test out the efficacy of several different machine learning algorithms
for processing the dataset.
All data was taken from the UCI dataset database; the dataset in question was originally gathered using the Dota 2 API created by Github
user kronusme.
